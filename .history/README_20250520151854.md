<div class="project-card">
  <div class="project-content">

    <div class="project-tags">

        <li>Achievement 3</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

</div>

## Contact Form Setup

The contact form in this template is set up for demonstration purposes and doesn't actually send emails by default. To make it functional, you'll need to:

1. Set up a backend service to handle form submissions (e.g., using AWS Lambda, Netlify Forms, or a custom server)
2. Update the form action and method in the HTML
3. Add any necessary form validation or CAPTCHA

Alternatively, you can use services like [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) or [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/) which require minimal setup.
